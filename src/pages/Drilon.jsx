                            Discord was launched in May 2015 by Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy as a communication platform specifically tailored for gamers. The idea stemmed from the
                            founders' frustration with existing tools that were either too complex, unreliable, or lacked the features necessary for effective communication within gaming communities.
                            Recognizing the need for a lightweight, efficient, and user-friendly platform, they set out to create a solution that prioritized seamless text, voice, and video communication.
                            Discord quickly gained traction, with its high-quality audio, intuitive interface, and reliable performance standing out among the alternatives, making it an essential tool for gamers worldwide.
